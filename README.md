# bad-apple-txt

- basically the same as bad-apple-rbx except I rewrote the entire thing to use a text file instead because it's way more efficient and the alternative method I was using didn't make a lot of sense anyway
- insert rbxm file into studio and make sure to put 'Screen' and 'Sounds' in the workspace
- also make sure you have all the correct dependencies preinstalled yada yada have fun
