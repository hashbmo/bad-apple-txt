# bad-apple-txt

- Basically the same as bad-apple-rbx except I rewrote the entire thing to use a text file instead because it's way more efficient and the alternative method I was using didn't make a lot of sense anyway
- For the uninitiated:
  - Clone the repository
  - Run server.py in your IDE of choice
  - Open ba_dev.rbxl and click play
  - Follow the on screen prompt to begin video playback

#### Notes

- Required libraries: opencv-python, waitress, flask
- Make sure you have these installed before you attempt to run server.py
